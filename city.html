    <h4>Hector Caleb Haight</h4>
    Hector Caleb Haight is unique in that he is claimed
     by two towns, Farmington and Kaysville, as their
      first settler. Shortly after the pioneers entered the
       Salt Lake Valley on July 24, 1847, Hector Haight was sent
        north to find grazing for the stock. On a beautiful stream in
         the Kaysville/Farmington area, Haight soon built a log cabin and brought his family to live there.
    
    <h4>Settlers</h4>
    Many more families must have arrived during the summer because, according to
     the 1850 census, there were over three hundred settlers in this part of the
      valley and it was time for the organization of a ward. On January 27, 1851
       Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball came to the Phillips home for that purpose.
        Edward Phillips was asked to be Bishop, but feeling unworthy he suggested William Kay,
         who was appointed. It was not until September of 1852 that the ward formally began
          to function with William Kay as Bishop, Edward Phillips as first counselor,
           and John H. Green as second counselor. This little settlement became known
            as Kay's Ward. "Little" really isn't the word to use because the settlement
             covered a great deal of territory - from Haight's Creek on the south to the
              Weber River on the north, and from the mountains on the east to the lake on
               the west. In 1856 William Kay was called on a mission to Carson Valley in
                what is now Nevada. After Bishop Kay left there was a desire on the part of
                 some of the people to have the name of the settlement changed from Kay's Ward
                  to Freedom. The request was presented to President Brigham Young and when he
                   bluntly asked, "When did Kay's Ward get its Freedom" his reply was taken as
                    disapproval and the matter was dropped.

 Demographic Information

<div class="content">
  <p>
    <h4>Demographics</h4>
    
    The majority of people coming to Kaysville up to 1852 were English.
     Of the 29 families who arrived before this date, 19 families came from England,
      three from New York, two from Vermont and one from Kentucky. No record can be found
       of the other four families. Later immigration to Kaysville seems to be in practically
        the same proportions. The majority of the people came from England or were of English descent.
         Most people lived on their farms with very few homes in the central part, which has since
          become the city of Kaysville. The first people to arrive settled on the streams or near the lake shore.
           There was no division of lands. A settler came in, saw a tract of land that suited him, and if not
            already occupied, took it up by fencing it and living on it.
     Several families came together and usually settled in the same neighborhood.
